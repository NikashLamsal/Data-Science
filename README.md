# Data Science Projects

This repository contains various data science projects focused on analyzing and visualizing data, as well as applying mathematical concepts to extract meaningful insights.

## Projects

### 1. Data Visualization

#### Description
This project focuses on visualizing data using Python and various visualization libraries. It demonstrates the use of different types of plots to analyze datasets and extract meaningful insights.

#### Dataset
This project uses a sample dataset named `Health_Heart_Experimental.csv`. The dataset contains information about various aspects of human health, such as blood pressure (BP), diabetes, BMI index, and more.

#### Features
- **Interactive visualizations** using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- **Dataset analysis** with Python libraries like `pandas` and `numpy`.
- **Easy-to-understand visual representation** of data.

### 2. Linear Algebra

#### Description
This project explores the application of linear algebra concepts in data science. It includes practical examples demonstrating how linear algebra is used in data analysis, machine learning, and more.

#### Key Concepts
- **Matrix operations** such as addition, multiplication, and inversion.
- **Eigenvalues and eigenvectors** and their role in dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.
- **Vector spaces** and transformations.
- **Solving systems of linear equations** using Python libraries.

#### Features
- **Real-world examples** demonstrating the application of linear algebra in data science.
- **Step-by-step explanations** of mathematical concepts.
- **Code implementations** using `numpy` for efficient computations.

### 3. Probability and Statistics

#### Description
This project applies probability and statistical concepts to analyze datasets. It demonstrates fundamental statistical measures and probability distributions for data analysis.

#### Dataset
This project uses the `iris.csv` dataset. The dataset contains measurements of different flower species, including petal and sepal length and width.

#### Features
- **Descriptive statistics** such as mean, median, mode, and standard deviation.
- **Probability distributions** and their applications.
- **Utilization of `sklearn`** for normalization and standardization.

### 4. Feature Engineering

#### Description
This project demonstrates the process of feature engineering, which involves creating new features from raw data to improve model performance in machine learning.

#### Dataset
This project uses the `titanic.csv` dataset. It contains information about Titanic passengers, including demographic details, ticket class, fare, and survival status.

#### Features
- **Principal Component Analysis (PCA)** for dimensionality reduction and feature selection.
- **Handling missing values** using imputation techniques.
- **Feature scaling and encoding** to transform categorical and numerical data for machine learning models.
- **Correlation analysis** to identify the most impactful features.
- **Statistical insights** on factors influencing survival.
- **Data preprocessing** for handling missing values and feature engineering.
