# Data Science Projects

This repository contains various data science projects focused on analyzing and visualizing data, as well as applying mathematical concepts to extract meaningful insights.

## Projects

### 1. Data Visualization

#### Description
This project focuses on visualizing data using Python and various visualization libraries. It demonstrates the use of different types of plots to analyze datasets and extract meaningful insights.

#### Dataset
This project uses a sample dataset named `Health_Heart_Experimental.csv`. The dataset contains information about various aspects of human health, such as blood pressure (BP), diabetes, BMI index, and more.

#### Features- **Interactive visualizations** using `matplotlib` and `seaborn`.
- **Dataset analysis** with Python libraries like `pandas` and `numpy`.
- **Easy-to-understand visual representation** of data.

### 2. Linear Algebra

#### Description
This project explores the application of linear algebra concepts in data science. It includes practical examples demonstrating how linear algebra is used in data analysis, machine learning, and more.

#### Key Concepts
- **Matrix operations** such as addition, multiplication, and inversion.
- **Eigenvalues and eigenvectors** and their role in dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA.
- **Vector spaces** and transformations.
- **Solving systems of linear equations** using Python libraries.

#### Features
- Real-world examples demonstrating the application of linear algebra in data science.
- Step-by-step explanations of mathematical concepts.
- Code implementations using `numpy` for efficient computations.
